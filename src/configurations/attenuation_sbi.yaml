# Configuration for approximating the posterior of an attenuation experiment with
# simualtion-based inference

# Path to pickled DataFrame which contains amplitudes of an attenuation experiment.
# The mean over different runs will be used as a target observation.
target: ~  # FIXME TODO this needs to be set

# Determines what kind of observation is extracted from the attenuation experiment
# and the provided target, e.g., length_constant, amplitudes, amplitudes_first
observation: length_constant

# Use the same leak conductance in all compartments and the same conductance between
# compartments for all connections between compartments
global_parameters: True

seed: ~  # Random seed for pytorch and numpy. If not set, no seed is used

sbi:
  algorithm: SNPE # algorithm used to approximate a posterior, e.g., SNPE, MCABC
  n_sim_first: 500  # Number of simulations in first approximation round
  n_sim_rest: 500  # Number of simulations in remaining approximation rounds
  n_rounds: 2  # Number of approximation rounds. Needs to be '1' for non-sequential algorithms

nde:
  model: maf  # Type of neural density estimator, e.g., maf, nsf, mdn
  n_transforms: 5  # Number of transforms for flow-based neural density estimators
  n_hidden: 50  # Number of features in hidden layers of neural density estimators
  z_score: independent  # How the observations are z-scored, e.g., none, independent, structured
